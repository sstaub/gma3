# LwIP
 Lightweight TCP/IP stack (LwIP)  is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite that has been initially developed by Adam Dunkels and is now continued [here](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/).

 Modified to fit Arduino libraries specifications.

 It is used by the [STM32Ethernet](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Ethernet) library.

## Version

This library is based on the version 2.1.2 of the LwIP stack.
